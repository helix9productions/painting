    <h2>The basics</h2>
    <p>To get started with painting, the first thing you nust learn about is the brush. The brush is a very simple yet powerful tool which is the most basic form with which you can interact with your painting. The brush's color can be changed using the color palette button, and its size can be adjusted from 1 pixel to 100 using the size slider on the editing toolbar.</p>
